### The Current State
Since the pre-proposal, we have pulled the relevant data from [New York City Taxi Trip Data](http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml) and [Wunderground](https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/) into .csv files.  TODO: mention the github page that we borrowed from. After extracting these two datasets, we wrote scripts to clean the data so that we could more easily integrate the two sets together. As the New York City taxi dataset is huge and involves multiple years, we realized the need for a way to randomly sample a portion of the dataset for faster queries. Therefore, we also wrote a script to take the .csv files and shrink them to a more manageable size.

Thus, we now have a database of tables from both datasets small enough but also representative enough for efficient queries. In the next section, we demonstrate an example query.
