### About

We aim to use transportation and weather data sets to optimize the routes that taxi drivers will take (to get to find their next pick up) and predict the profits by time of day in New York City. There are two parts to this process. First we will look at pickup and drop off points by time of day for taxi rides in NYC. Given this information we plan on devising an approximation algorithm to create ideal routes for a Taxi driver to take from any location. Hopefully we can use weather as a variable to see how these routes might change due to current environmental conditions.
